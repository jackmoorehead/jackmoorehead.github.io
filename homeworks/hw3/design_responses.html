							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>White's musing's on type workflows connect 
								with the previous weeks content about visual hierarchy and layout, and how type plays a role in the 
								overall scheme of a website. Previously, most of my cartogrpahic design work had been based on templates 
								and 'best practices.' However, I now have an understanding regarding the complexity of design choices, 
								how the process to simplify, visualize, and communicate ideas in graphic form is one of the most 
								demanding tasks. My way of seeing and thinking with type has radically changed. Each design 
								moving forward will consist of this robust approach.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Generally, the structure of how the article flows into the next point itself demonstrates the power 
								of thoughtful design. Purpose is to come before concrete choices on typographic families and fonts, 
								as thoroughly demonstrated by the argumentative flow. Particulary, the apogee of the article comes at the
								end. All of the theoretical, practical, visual, and mathematical points made cumuluate in the statement 
								about how typography is both art and science. This crescendo amplified how much different disciplinary 
								ideas gather in design.
