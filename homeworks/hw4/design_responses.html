							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> We typically choose color on preference. While our psychological preference 
								can potentially have empirical scientific reasons or cultural significance, these 
								decisions should always be treated with care. A care for the people we design for, 
								and the information we communicate through the refleciton of light to the eye and brain. 
								Building off typography, I'm now understanding the complex system of representation that 
								goes into a singular design.

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> After discussing the ethical practice implications of accessible design, 
								I loved the section on legal issues. Having studied critical visual culture 
								and political rhetoric some, it is intriguing to sit with the idea of design 
								as a form of politics. In civil society, the institutions are to be upheld by
								people with freedoms: design, then, is a public service to be rigorously upheld 
								by continuous remodelling of theory and practice. If design wasn't important, then 
								there would not be legal frameworks. But on par with speech + expression, visual
								language should be reflective of the community it serves.
