    <p><em>geography + gisci // 4th year</em></p>
    <p>Ciao, I'm Jack, a community college transfer in their final year of undergraduate studies.
        Born with deafness in my right ear, my eye is always focusing on the visual field: whether its graphics, 
        film, photography, natural/cultural landscapes, color, etc. etc. etc. I turned my hearing loss into 
        a powerful vessel by combining my intense observation of landscapes and visual eye into geographic practice 
        and cartographic representation :) I spend most of my days trying to tell people what the "cartographic" is, 
        and why it matters. Otherwise, I surf, bike, root for the Giants and Kings, read books of all kinds, and 
        obssess over cities and their form. And Teju Cole, Doreen Massey always.  
    </p>

        <h3>Reading Review</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing an eye for design is a matter of learning to see. Most design- regardles of profession/discipline- 
                produces affective responses cognitively. It's most evident when we watch a beautiful film and feel 
                apart of its atmosphere, but this reaction sparks a "How did they do that?" question. 
                All design disciplines have their own constraints to overcome. For me, it is Cartographic Design that I am always 
                developing an eye for as I study more in-depth and engage with more 
                well-designed maps. I appreciate Warner's approach of 'developing an eye' since I am constantly doing this with 
                maps: placing myself in another Cartographer's position, deciphering how they developed a design solution. 
            </li>
            <li>Warner's section on "Don't just use apps, study them" is informative on how to develop 
                a way of seeing in design. Language builds the image, and here Warner offers insightful questions
                to ask while studying design. These questions establish a foundation upon which to build from throughout 
                the semester as I learn to design websites that are both functional and aesthetic to the user. 
                This language then allows me to dig deeper into design principles being executed in the interface.  
            </li>
            <li><em>"I was obsessed with copying pieces of the trending Dribbble shots, but oblivious to how all the pieces worked together."</em>
                This quote is simple yet has so much depth. It speaks to a trend in multiple industries where 
                there is a growing lack of genuine inellectual approaches to practice, with the sage advice being 'just 
                hack it' and 'google it'. While copying/forking/googling has its merits at times, its difficult to proclaim 
                'I am ____' without an appreciation of a discipline's function, aesthetics, and politics. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>8</strong>. The article was concise and informative about engaging UI/UX design in everyday 
                elements. Additionally, it is always pleasing to see professionals acknowledge their 
                initial shortcomings in their career, and how they shifted their mindset to practice. 
                However, I am a total nerd and do appreciate more complex articles that totally
                reorient my way of thinking. In the future, I would appreciate more in-depth readings about design
                as I am choosing to take the DeCal for desingn purposes. There should be a mix of 
                both: quick, informative pieces from industry, and longer academic pieces (textbook, theory, etc.)
                which should sit on our minds as we design and code.
