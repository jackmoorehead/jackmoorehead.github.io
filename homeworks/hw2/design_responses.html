							<p>What is something you learned from this article?</p>
							<p> A majority of the article placed observations I previously had about certain website designs into a more formal language. 
								It was interesting to also place into perspective how designers and developer's work together on these tasks. I always had 
								this idea that designer's needed to be total polymath's and know how to think visually, code, carry out pyschological research, 
								research/write reports, and do basic data analysis when needed. It's comforting to know that segmenting tasks is still appreciated 
								in the industry.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article?</p>
							<p> I am a visual thinker, so the part's of the article where the author descirbes their principles using website comparisons was 
								extremely effective for following the argument. These principle's demonstrated to me that a lot of design is expanding upon initial 
								observations to reiterate new ways of seeing. Also how a lot of design is geometric, it ties back to a lot of arguments in mathematics 
								about an inherent 'beauty' in visual field. The author breaking down pixel padding into rules of 8 somewhat demosntrates the idea.

							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 4. The article has its moments where it produces brief insight, but then doesn't elaborate on how these principle's are the case. 
								For instance, 'spacing increases readability', a valid point from practice, but empirically how is this the case? In fact, there's a point 
								in the article where he mentions how these principle's aren't 'myths', but doesn't cite the foundations on which the argument is made.
								Aside from empirical cognition, there is <a href="https://jarrettfuller.com/projects/against-design">running discourse on the idea of 'design thinking'</a> equating to product thinking, 
								eroding our thinking as pure practice to adhering to a set of rules defined by a larger political economic system. In reflection, was the wireframe I made in accordance with design principles 
								as defined by Capital or what is beautiful in the eye from a sense of pyschophysical perception, aesthetics, and cultural context? I agree 
								with some of the principle's laid out, there obviously are some design practices that visually make sense as opposed to others. But 
								there is this strange lack of acknowledgement that the principles are situated within a business setting. Design matters because people matter, 
								not products.
